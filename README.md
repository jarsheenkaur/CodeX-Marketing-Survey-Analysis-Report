- **Age Distribution:** 55% of energy drink consumers are aged 19-30, with the figure rising to 70% in the 15-30 age bracket. Globally, younger demographics are the largest consumers of energy drinks, as they are marketed for high-energy lifestyles such as sports and long study or work hours.
- **City Insights:** Bangalore leads with 28% of energy drink consumers, followed by Hyderabad at 18%. In contrast, Lucknow accounts for only 2%. Urban areas tend to have higher energy drink consumption due to the fast-paced lifestyle, which aligns with the growth of energy drinks in metro cities like Bangalore.
- **Consumption Frequency:** Energy drinks are frequently consumed 2-3 times per week, primarily by males and individuals aged 18-30.

### **2. Consumer Preferences**
- **Primary Consumption Reasons:** Consumers primarily drink energy beverages to stay awake during work/study and before exercise, with the top motivations being increased energy and focus. Globally, the energy drink market thrives on the promise of alertness and productivity boosts, valued highly by students and professionals.
- **Consumption Occasions:** Most respondents consume energy drinks during sports or exercise, mirroring global trends where energy drinks are heavily marketed to athletes and fitness enthusiasts for performance enhancement.

### **3. Purchasing Behavior**
- **Preferred Purchase Channels:** Supermarkets are the most common purchase location, followed by online retailers. In India, the rapid rise of e-commerce has driven the growth of online purchases of energy drinks, especially during the pandemic.
- **Packaging Preference:** Consumers favor compact and portable cans, followed by innovative bottle designs. This reflects the global trend where convenience in consumption plays a significant role, with compact packaging preferred for ease of transportation and storage. Additionally, there is little interest in limited edition packaging, indicating that energy drink packaging should focus on everyday practicality rather than exclusivity or novelty.
- **Price Sensitivity:** The preferred price range for energy drinks is between INR 50-99. Pricing is a critical factor in the Indian market, where affordability often determines brand loyalty, especially in the youth segment.

### **4. Market Research**
- **Effective Marketing Channels:** Online ads are most effective in reaching young consumers, particularly through platforms like Instagram and YouTube. Globally, digital marketing has proven to be the most powerful tool for energy drinks, particularly in engaging younger, tech-savvy audiences.

- **Trial Rates:** Only 49% of respondents have tried CodeX, indicating a gap in market penetration. 
- **Taste Rating:** CodeXâ€™s taste rating of 3.28 shows room for improvement, especially since taste/flavor is the second most important factor for brand preference .
- **Barriers to Trial:** Limited availability and health concerns are the main reasons preventing consumers from trying CodeX. This indicates that the brand needs to address both distribution challenges and health-related perceptions to succeed .
- **City-wise Availability:** CodeX is most available in Bangalore (36%), but barely available in cities like Ahmedabad and Lucknow (1%). Expanding availability in these regions could lead to increased trials and brand growth.
